# Color Schemes Framework via ChatGPT

This project aims to be a useful set of tools for working with color schemes.

Initial motivation behind the idea is that I was having ChatGPT spit out various
color hexadecimal color schemes in response to various prompts.

Prompts and responses are listed, and scripts in this repository are used to then
generate HTML for visual output.

***Feature Ideas***

- Save schemes and hexadecimal colors in a SQLite Database.
- Produce Text, Buttons, Backgrounds, different arrangements of elements based on the schemes.
- Organize schmes based on prompt 'themes', eg: fun and lively, professional, sporty, calming, pastels, etc.

***Initial Technical Notes***

- Started with an initial Pipenv file using Python 3.11.6, although Python may not end up being the main devolpment/implementaion environment.
